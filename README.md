# Project Steps and Key Decisions

## 1. Data Collection and Initial Exploration
We started with three main data files:

* [`calendar.csv`](./data/calendar.csv): Contains availability and pricing information
* [`listings.csv`](./data/listings.csv): Detailed information about each Airbnb listing
* [`reviews.csv`](./data/reviews.csv): User reviews for the listings

**Key Decision:**  We focused primarily on the [`listings.csv`](./data/listings.csv) file as it contained the most relevant information for price prediction.

## 2. Data Cleaning and Preparation

Handled missing values
Converted data types (e.g., dates, prices) to appropriate formats
Removed extreme outliers to improve data quality

**Key Decision:** We chose to remove extreme price outliers (above 99th percentile) to prevent them from skewing our model.

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Price Distribution

This histogram shows the distribution of Airbnb prices in NYC. We observed that:

* Prices are heavily right-skewed
* Most listings are concentrated in the lower price range
* There are some very high-priced outliers

**Key Decision:** Given the skewed nature of prices, we decided to use a log transformation on the price variable to make it more normally distributed for our model.

###Price by Room Type###

![price_by_room_type](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/679835bb-d83e-4d19-b5c1-e2479f97cfd0)

This box plot displays how prices vary across different room types. We found that:

* Entire homes/apartments are generally more expensive
* Shared rooms are the least expensive option
* There's significant price overlap between private rooms and entire homes/apartments

**Key Decision:** Room type is clearly an important factor in determining price, so we made sure to include it as a key feature in our model.

Correlation Matrix

![correlation_matrix](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d30fd767-c1a3-435c-9326-5a4039fcc5d1)

This heatmap shows the correlations between different numerical features. Notable observations:

* 'Number of reviews' and 'reviews per month' are highly correlated (as expected)
* 'Availability 365' (number of days available in a year) has a moderate negative correlation with price

**Key Decision:** Based on these correlations, we decided to engineer new features that could capture more complex relationships in the data.

## 4. Feature Engineering

We created several new features to capture more information:

*availability_rate: Percentage of days a listing is available
*avg_price: Average price for each listing
*price_category: Categorized prices into low, medium, high
*days_since_last_review: To capture the recency of reviews
*is_licensed: Whether the listing is licensed

**Key Decision:** We created the availability_rate feature because we noticed that availability had a relationship with price, but it wasn't perfectly linear. This new feature allowed our model to capture more nuanced patterns.

## 5. Model Development
We used XGBoost for our final model due to its strong performance on tabular data. Here's how we approached model development:

1. Split the data into training and testing sets
2. Created a pipeline that included:
   * Preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling numerical features)
   * Feature selection
   * XGBoost model
3. Used RandomizedSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters

Final model performance:

* RÂ² Score: 0.8064 (The model explains about 80.64% of the variance in listing prices)
* Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.0726
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.2694
* Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): 15.35% (On average, our predictions are off by about 15.35%)

**Key Decision:** We chose XGBoost and fine-tuned its parameters because it consistently outperformed other algorithms we tried, including linear regression and random forests.

6. Interactive Web Application

We created a Streamlit web app that allows users to:

* Input details about a potential Airbnb listing
* View interactive data visualizations
* Get a real-time price prediction based on the input

![price_app](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6587367a-c1b2-4db3-9a70-10847dc813ef)
![data_full](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f27567e-1506-4d85-8245-87217de57e9e)


**Key Decision:** We chose Streamlit for its simplicity and ease of deployment, making our model accessible to non-technical users.

## Challenges Faced

1. **Data Quality Issues:** The raw dataset contained missing values and outliers. We addressed this by implementing robust data cleaning procedures and carefully considering which data points to exclude to maintain data integrity without losing valuable information.

```python
# Example of handling missing values
df['reviews_per_month'] = df['reviews_per_month'].fillna(0)

# Removing extreme price outliers
df = df[df['price'] <= df['price'].quantile(0.99)]
```
2. **Feature Engineering:** Creating meaningful features that capture the complexities of Airbnb pricing was challenging. We overcame this by combining domain knowledge with data-driven insights.
```python
# Creating availability rate feature
df['availability_rate'] = df['availability_365'] / 365

# Creating price per night feature
df['price_per_night'] = df['price'] / df['minimum_nights'].clip(lower=1)
```
3. **Model Optimization:** Balancing model complexity with performance was tricky. We used RandomizedSearchCV to efficiently search the hyperparameter space and find the optimal model configuration.
```python
# Hyperparameter tuning with RandomizedSearchCV
param_distributions = {
    'model__n_estimators': [100, 200, 300],
    'model__max_depth': [3, 4, 5, 6],
    'model__learning_rate': [0.01, 0.1, 0.3]
}
random_search = RandomizedSearchCV(pipeline, param_distributions, n_iter=20, cv=5, random_state=42)
```
4. **Interpreting Complex Models:** XGBoost models can be challenging to interpret. We addressed this by using feature importance plots and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to understand the model's decision-making process.

## Code Snippets

Here are some key code snippets that showcase important parts of our project:

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
```python
def prepare_features(df):
    df_selected = df[important_features + ['price']].copy()
    
    df_selected['reviews_per_month'] = df_selected['reviews_per_month'].fillna(0)
    df_selected['price_per_night'] = df_selected['avg_price'] / df_selected['minimum_nights'].clip(lower=1)
    df_selected['is_superhost'] = (df_selected['calculated_host_listings_count'] > 1).astype(int)
    df_selected['high_availability'] = (df_selected['availability_365'] > 180).astype(int)
    
    return df_selected
```
2. **Model Pipeline Creation:**
```python
pythonCopydef create_model_pipeline(numeric_features, categorical_features):
    numeric_transformer = Pipeline(steps=[
        ('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='median')),
        ('scaler', RobustScaler())
    ])

    categorical_transformer = Pipeline(steps=[
        ('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='constant', fill_value='Unknown')),
        ('onehot', OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore', sparse_output=False))
    ])

    preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
        transformers=[
            ('num', numeric_transformer, numeric_features),
            ('cat', categorical_transformer, categorical_features)
        ])

    model = xgb.XGBRegressor(random_state=42, n_jobs=-1)

    pipeline = Pipeline([
        ('preprocessor', preprocessor),
        ('feature_selection', SelectKBest(f_regression, k='all')),
        ('model', model)
    ])

    return pipeline
```
3. **Streamlit App (Price Prediction Section):**

```python
if st.button('Predict Price'):
    try:
        user_input = user_input[model.feature_names_in_]
        prediction = np.expm1(model.predict(user_input))
        st.success(f'The predicted price is ${prediction[0]:.2f} per night')
    except Exception as e:
        st.error(f"An error occurred during prediction: {str(e)}")
```

## Key Findings

1. Location (neighborhood) and room type are the strongest predictors of Airbnb prices in NYC
2. The number of reviews and review frequency have a notable impact on pricing
3. Availability throughout the year moderately affects pricing
4. There's a non-linear relationship between price and minimum nights stay

## Future Improvements

1. Incorporate external data like proximity to attractions or public transport
2. Implement time-series analysis to capture seasonal price variations
3. Experiment with more advanced machine learning techniques, such as deep learning models
4. Create an automated pipeline to regularly update the model with new data
